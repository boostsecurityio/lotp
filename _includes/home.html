<h2><em>Living Off the Pipeline</em></h2>

<p>
    The idea of the LOTP project is to inventory how development tools (typically CLIs), commonly used in CI/CD pipelines, have lesser-known RCE-By-Design features ("foot guns"), or more generally, can be used to achieve arbitrary code execution by running on untrusted code changes or following a workflow injection.
