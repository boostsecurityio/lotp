# Introduction

The idea of the LOTP project is to inventory how development tools (typically CLIs), commonly used in CI/CD pipelines, have lesser-known RCE-By-Design features ("foot guns"), or more generally, can be used to achieve arbitrary code execution by running on untrusted code changes or following a workflow injection.

# Contributions

We welcome contributions submitted as `Pull Requests` with new tool contributions or simply `Issues` for new ideas.
